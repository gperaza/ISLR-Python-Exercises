Use the rejection algorithm to generate X~N(0,1) in two ways:

1. Apply simple rejection sampling, draw the proposals from a uniform distribution.

2. Draw the proposals from a standard exponential Exp(1) distribution.

Compare the rejection rate between the two approaches.

Tip: When sampling using the exponential as an envelope, you cannot sample from
the complete domain (the rejection rate would be extremely high), restrict
yourselves to the positive domain (0,Infinity) and sample from the positive side
of the exponential. Then, whenever you accept a proposal, with probability 1/2,
change its sign.

Tip: Remember to find M such that it is as close to 1 as possible and
M*g(x)>f(x) for all x.
