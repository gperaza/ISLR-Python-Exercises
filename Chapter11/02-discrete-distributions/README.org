Write a function that generates random numbers from a discrete probability mass
function. It must accept tree arguments:
 - A list of values.
 - A list of probabilities, such that p[i] = p(a[i])
 - The size of the sample.

Test your function by generating a large sample for the following mass function:
| a |   1 |   3 |   4 |
|---+-----+-----+-----|
| p | 3/5 | 1/5 | 1/5 |

A function to plot a probability mass function is provided. Please understand
how it works. Remember you can read python documentation online.
