Reconsider the jury example from class. Suppose the first jury member is bribed
to vote in favor of the present candidate.
 a) How should you now model Y_{1}? Implement a model to investigate which of
    the two rules is less sensitive to the effect of the bribery.
 b) The International Skating Union decided to adopt a rule similar to the
    following: randomly discard two of the jury scores, then average the
    remaining scores. Implement a model investigate this rule. Did you find this
    rule to be more sensitive to the bribery than the two rules already
    discussed, or less sensitive?

A tiny financial model. To investigate investment strategies, consider the
following:

You can choose to invest your money in one particular stock or put it in a
savings account. Your initial capital is $1000. The interest rate r is 0.5% per
month and does not change. The initial stock price is $100. Your stochastic
model for the stock price is as follows: next month the price is the same as
this month with probability 1/2, with probability 1/4 it is 5% lower, and with
probability 1/4 it is 5% higher. This principle applies for every new month.
There are no transaction costs when you buy or sell stock.

Your investment strategy for the next 5 years is: convert all your money to
stock when the price drops below $95, and sell all stock and put the money
in the bank when the stock price exceeds $110.

Implement a simulation for the results of this strategy for the model given.
Analyze this results.
