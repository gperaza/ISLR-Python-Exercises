    "In the Lab, we saw that sklearn module can be used in order to compute the LOOCV test error estimate. Alternatively, one could compute those quantities using just the logit() function toguether with its predict() method and a for loop.  You will now take this approach in order to compute the LOOCV error for a simple logistic regression model on the Weekly data set. Recall that in the context of classification problems, the LOOCV error is given in (5.4)."
